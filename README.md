# NFL Head Coach Play Calling Tendencies
Analyzing the play calling tendencies of NFL head coaches by game situation based on their historical career play calls.

# NFL Head Coach Play Calling Tendencies

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  This model was created to evaluate the play calling tendencies of each NFL Head Coach by determining the number, and percentage, of the four general play types (pass, run, punt, and field goal attempts) they call throughout a game.
</p>

<p>
  The model breaks these play calls down by certain game situations, the average outcome of these plays, and the differences in tendencies and performance of coaches (above or below average) versus their peers.
</p>

<p>
  To assist in this evaluation, a prediction model was built that captures the expected play call of head coaches based on several in-game factors, which considered things such as: weather, down, field position, yards to go, score, time left, and timeouts remaining. From this, an expected play call metric was developed which was used to measure a coach's tendency to call plays unexpectedly give the situation and how they compare to league average tendencies.
